(RavenQt SIG Meeting Minutes for 2021-05-12:)'
(==========================================)'

(1\) Discussion of known problems)'
(        -P2SH patch, Sweep, other)'

(2\) Discussion of overall bounty issues)'

(3\) Discussion of promoting testing)'

(4\) Current thoughts on release plans)'

(===)'

(-Today's meeting was shorter than usual. We agreed that the top priority was additional testing of v4.7test1)'
()'
(-We briefly discussed the problem in which v4.7test1 cannot sync on mainnet)'
(        -mainnet contains some non-standard transactions with outputs which look similar to P2SH but don't work prop)'
(erly)'
(        -eg: txid=39aaaed0ccd038e9304e230ecba7b2b9457252cc0b4deb7245d4c2e03a186564&decode=1)'

(        -The code required OP_RVN_ASSET to be at offset 25 in order to recognize the asset script. It also requires )'

(t the asset gets transferred. But due to the length, the code still misinterprets it as a P2PKH output. Because of t)'
(hat it takes the P2SH redeemscript, ignores the first byte, appends the opcode 87 as the last byte, and misinterpret)'
(s that as a HASH160 from which it calculates a P2PKH address. So the asset gets transferred to an address which nobo)'
(dy has the keys to.)'
(        -The code in the P2SH PR freezes sync when it sees this transaction)'
()'
(-We discussed the Sweep PR.)'
(        -It is not useful for most users since it requires a full set of indexes on the raven-qt node)'
(        -It can be useful for some service-providers who run a full node, so we can choose to leave the PR in)'
(        -However, the implementation has some known bugs found, such as restricted asset support)'
(        -There have been suggestion to re-implement using an external API, but such things are generally discouraged)'
( on nodes for privacy reasons)'
(        -There have also been suggestions of re-implementing using a key import followed by a rescan. That would be )'
(a much better way, but is a complete re-write.)'

(        -We agreed that staying as close as possible to the bitcoin codebase is a worthwhile goal so that Ravencoin )'
