(RavenQt SIG Meeting Minutes for 2021-04-21:)'
(==========================================)'
()'
(1\) Discussion of current flow for approvals and commits)'
(    -How much to do by local-git/push vs the github GUI?)'
(    -Any remaining problems caused by lack of admin priviledge?)'
()'
(    -We have processed 34 Pull Requests as commits on branch develop since master)'
(        -each of them went through code review by at least 2 people and successfully built)'
(        -the git history is a clean linear history with one commit per PR)'
()'
(    -We had a short discussion of the advantages/disadvantages of using the github GUI vs git CLI)'
(        -we agreed that we would enforce the desired result, rather than the methodology)'
(        -we reiterated the PR rules:)'
(            -at least 2-person approval \(not including the author\))'
(            -must successfully build)'
(            -minimum 1 week review period)'
(        -but we agreed that those rules would be enforced manually, not by the GUI)'
(        -in some cases the GUI is unpredictable or undesireable)'
(        -we briefly discussed the "linear commits" setting but are unfamiliar with it)'
(        -we briefly discussed the ability to revise historical commit messages but were unsure how github responded)'
()'
(    We discussed the fact that we still do not have admin privileges on RavenProject)'
(        -this no longer limits our productivity)'
(        -using branch creation, deletion, and renaming, we have been able to defeat all github security measures)'
(        -we would like to be able to inspect and enable some security settings where appropriate)'
(        -but since we don't have admin rights, we are forced to leave security open or whatever the default is)'
(        -the Electrum SIG doesn't suffer this limitation since they own their github account, so they can set securi)'
(ty optimally)'
()'
(    We need to update the documentation files in the repository to match our rules and procedures)'
()'
(    We discussed that prior to any mainnet release, there should be a 2 week "string freeze" period)'
(        -during that period, volunteers can submit translations for other languages)'
()'
(2\) Discussion of testnet release & mainnet release plans)'
(    -the new PRs)'
(    -P2SH)'
(    -expected schedule)'
()'
(    We currently have 11 unmerged PRs up to PR#944)'
(        -we agreed that we plan to process all of these into the upcoming testnet release)'
(            -this includes 5 large commits from bitcoin to update secp256k1 with the latest upstream changes)'
(        -we agreed that we do not currently plan to update univalue due to possible merge issues caused by kaawpow)'

(    We discussed the release plans again)'
(        -we still plan to do a mainnet release \(post testnet testing\) fairly soon which does not contain P2SH)'
(        -that will be followed by a 2nd mainnet release later which has P2SH)'
(        -however, the 1st testnet release will actually contain all the code including P2SH)'
(            -The BIP9 parameters will be set to enable testmet activation at 60%, but never on mainnet)'
()'
(3\) Discussion of build system status & issues)'
()'
(    Hans reported that the linux binaries built by the new build system do not function on Ubuntu 18 or older)'
(        -an error "version `GLIBC_2.29' not found"/"version `GLIBC_2.28' not found" is generated)'
()'
(4\) Discussion of any specific PRs & Commits)'
()'
(    We discussed the list of https URLs which Hans extracted from PR922)'
(        -these all came from the bitcoin dependency and patch updates + some openssl references)'
(        -some of them are private github repositories)'
(        -Hyperpeek reported that he looked at those and they looked trustworthy)'
(        -fdov encouraged further review)'
()'
(    We discussed the updates to the autobuild system in the .github repo subdirectory)'
(        -these did not come from bitcoin. they were alread part of the Ravencoin repo)'
(        -fdov only updated the code to fix broken functionality)'
(        -the code was added originally by Cade Call from Medici; not sure where he got it)'
