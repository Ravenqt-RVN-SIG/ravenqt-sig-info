RavenQt SIG Meeting Minutes for 2021-04-28:
==========================================

We are very close to the testnet release. So today's agenda will focus on that:

1) Discussion of things left to do before the testnet release

2) Discussion of release plans and schedules

3) Future plans

-We agreed that Testnet BIP9 parameters would be set at 70% (not 60% as discussed earlier)

-We agreed that although mainnet should not add additional PRs after testnet testing, there should be some exceptions, especially for documetation and translation. 

-We discussed a release plan similar to that used by bitcoin, which includes string freeze times to allow for language translations, and also Release Candidates:
	Release schedule start with a soft string-freeze. 
	+2 weeks: feature freeze and hard string freeze.
	testnet - 4.7
	+2 weeks: split into release branch, rc1 is tagged and released.
	+4 weeks: release.

-We re-opened the possibility that we may want to do a mainnet release which does not include P2SH due to current P2SH problems.
-The new version of raven-qt V4.7test1 cannot currently be used on mainnet. Mainnet contains some non-standard transactions which look like P2SH but have additional Op_0 opcodes inserted to pad the ScriptOubKey. That transactions cause node sync to fail.
-The P2SH code will need to be revised again and tested on both testnet and mainnet before release

-We discussed the version numbering for the mainnet release
-We decided that it should be >=v4.8 and <v5.0. This is because there are many scam wallets being pushed by hackers, and most of them are claiming to be v4.4

-We agreed that when we are ready for mainnet release, master should ideally be a complete merge/rebase from develop, not cherry picking

-We agreed that in the future, for "official" mainnet releases, they will be hosted on RavenProject
-For testnet releases, they will be hosted on the SIG website. But they will include hashes and GPG signatures for verification.

-We agreen that the tesnet release will include all PR's currently outstanding

-Schedule: Merge P2SH tomorrow; so builds on Thursday evening; Set BIP9 start date to Sunday 18:00 UTC

-Hans agreed to start writing the Release Notes for the new version node

-We agreed that the name of the downloads would include the word "test" to make clear that it is for testnet.
